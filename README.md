# Tictactoe-rs

A basic tictactoe game written in Rust. This is a project I gave myself in order to learn Rust. It can be greatly improved.

The ways it can be improved are:

- Better input parsing instead of just using expects
- Implementing checks for if the game is unwinnable
- Writing tests

...and more that I can't think of right now.

I will try to improve this over time. **If you have any advice for me, it would be greatly appreciated as an issue into what I can do to improve this project.**
